### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the Sepsis Patient Dataset to determine the correlation with Lung or Respiratory failure. By analyzing various aspects of the data, I am seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the correlation between different biomarkers, and how it will affect the sepsis patient based on this analysis will provide recommendations to detect early signs of Sepsis infection.

### Problem Statement
Sepsis is a serious medical condition caused by the bodyâ€™s improper response to an infection which leads to damage to its vital organs and may lead to death.
Biomarkers are different tests and conditions that can help to identify Sepsis, its symptoms, stages, and diagnosis. Eg. O2Sat, HCO3, PaCO3, SBP, DBP, HR, Temp, Resp etc.

Early detection of Sepsis signs will help to curb the infection and save patients by initiating proper and in-time treatment.


### Data Sources 

Sepsis Patient Dataset: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Dataset1.xlsx" file, containing 40336 unique patients and their lab result information.
Size of the sample: 1.5M. The data has 43 features which can broadly be classified into
- Demographics
- Vital Signs
- Laboratory values
- Total no. of patients: 40336
- The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.com-

### Tools 
Tools used for Data Analysis and Report generation :
- Excel
- Tableau 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the Sepsis Patient dataset to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the correlation between Sepsis infection and different biomarkers or lab tests?
- How and what are different biomarkers that will contribute to lung or respiratory failure of Sepsis Patients?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting codes/features that I have worked with
- LOD functions, Calculated fields. For example
  ~~~ Calculated field using LOD function
     Count of Sepsis, Non-Sepsis, Onset Patients :
        IF {FIXED [Patient ID] : MIN([Sepsis Label])} = 1 THEN "Sepsis Patient"
        ELSEIF {FIXED [Patient ID] : MIN([Sepsis Label])} = 0 AND
                {FIXED [Patient ID] : MAX([Sepsis Label])} = 1 THEN "Onset Patient"
        ELSE "Non-Sepsis Patient"
        END
  ~~~

- Advanced visualization charts like Funnel charts, Stacked Sunburst charts, Heatmap charts, Dendrogram charts, Infrographic charts etc.
- Customized dashboard.
 
### Insights

As per my analysis, among all patients with Sepsis, Onset and SIRS, around 10%  to 20% of patients who experience either with Lung, Kidney, Heart or Liver Failure are at high risk of mortality exceeding 90%
- The Analysis results are summarized in the presentation file included here. Please download     the Presentation file including all dashboard, charts, insights and findings here :

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Healthcare professional can impletement similar dashboards to alert the caregiver whenever Patient's conditions starts changing abnormally.
- Implement a strategy to detect early signs of Sepsis and provide proper diagnosis.
